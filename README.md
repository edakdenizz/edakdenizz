Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Edanur Karadeniz
I'm a Computer Engineering student at HaliÃ§ University in Istanbul. My passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision has led me to work on various exciting projects, especially in deep learning and autonomous systems.

ðŸ”¬ Currently, I'm developing AI-powered solutions for national science and technology competitions like TÃœBÄ°TAK and Teknofest. My project focuses on computer vision, leveraging technologies such as OpenCV, CNN, and YOLO for real-time object detection and analysis.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always eager to gain international experience, apply my skills in a practical, real-world environment, and push the boundaries of my field by experimenting with new ideas.

ðŸ’¡ When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new AI frameworks, working on innovative projects, or enjoying a good strategy game.
